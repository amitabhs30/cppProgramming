1. Traditional 2D matrix arr[R][C]
2. C Style - Double pointer-- **arr: where there is an array of pointers containing the
first address of first element of every row(which is also a pointer), thus double pointer.
3. C++ - Array of vectors- vector<int> arr[R] :as the name says we have a array of vectors where each vector 
represents the row in our matrix and the size of array represents the no. of rows.
In this type of declaration the size of an individual row is dynamic in nature but the no. of rows is not dynamic.
4.c++ -vector of vector- vector<vector<int>>arr:As the name says we have a vector containing 
vectors(individual rows of the matrix).
the no. of vectors in the vector<vector<int>> represents the no. of rows in the matrix.
In this type of declaration the size of rows and column is both dynamic in nature, both can 
be changed while implementation.
